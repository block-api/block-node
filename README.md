## Overview

**block-node** is open source, relatively small framework written in Go language.

Main purpose of this project is to provide communication layer for application over protocols/services listed below:

- [ ] P2P
- [ ] TCP
- [ ] Redis
- [ ] NATS

This should allow you to build decentralized applications (Web 3.0) as well as microservices (Web 2.0).

In the future it will provide out of the box support for couple of databases as well:

- [ ] LevelDB
- [ ] MongoDB
- [ ] CouchDB

## Configuration

In root directory you can find `config.example.yml` file which includes available options to configure.

## TBD

This section presents features to be discussed if they should be implemented in the future:

- WebSockets
- HTTP (eg. for REST API)
